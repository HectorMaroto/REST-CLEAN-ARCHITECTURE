To simulate API requests I used Postman, and Mongo Compass to manage the database.
I have implemented JWT for user's authentication and protect the server's routes.
To test the app, you can send get and post requests to the following routes:

```GET - /api/auth```
```POST - /api/auth/login```
```POST - /api/auth/register```

App's flow:

- You send a register request to the server
- The server validates user's credentials
- The server generates a token and sign it with a secret key (generated with openssl)
- The hashed jwt is sent with the linked user's info
- With that jwt in the request header we can send the GET request to get the database's users and the last registered user as 'token' from the protected route.
